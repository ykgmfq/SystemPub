# SystemPub
Monitor ZFS pools and systemd units using Home Assistant and MQTT.

SytemPub is designed for [*sanoid*](https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid) users who don't run a dedicated monitoring service like [*Nagios*](https://nagios.org) but also don't want to rely on a cloud service like [*Healthchecks*](https://healthchecks.io/).

SystemPub checks health and capacity of your local ZFS pools. It also verifies whether snapshots have been created as configured in sanoid.
Under the hood, the Nagios-compatible `sanoid --monitor-X` commands are used.

Systemd is queried for any failed services.
For remote backups, this is a great way to see if `syncoid` has failed to pull snapshots.

The pool state and system unit state are published as [binary sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor.mqtt/) on your MQTT server.
Autodiscovery is supported, so there is no need for any further configuration in Home Assistant.

## Installation
